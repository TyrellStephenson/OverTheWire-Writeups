## Level 11 → Level 12

## Goal 
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions


## Solution

### Commands Used
```bash

cat data.txt | tr "A-Za-z" "N-ZA-Mn-za-m"

```

### Explanation
probably the first truly frustrating level, the wikipedia page attached to the level mentioned tr in the examples but i didnt read further as there was a format there i didnt want to just copy. So i tried the manual for tr , cant say it was enlightening but using it and some googling helped me understand that essentially there are two sets of strings , string1 and 2 and that you use them to make changes. 

so i tried 

``` bash 

tr "a-z" "n-m"

```
this didnt return anything so i tried adding a pipe operator with cat data.txt to direct the text into the tr command 

```bash 

cat data.txt | tr "a-z" "n-m"

```
here i got a reverse collating sequence order , and i have to be honest , Stack Overflow just confused me more , googles automatic AI explained to me that the string values have to be in ascending order , which was frustrating cause they couldnt be in ascending order but also maintain the rot13 format 

well after racking my brain for ages i caved and searched up the typical syntax and realized that i had been going about it wrong , i was trying to map string 1 to string 2 when how it works is that string one is what it searches for and string 2 is the full format for mapping 

```bash 

tr "A-Za-z" "N-ZA-Mn-za-m"


```
- n maps onto z and a maps onto m is essentially what the second string is saying 


### Key Concepts

REMEMBER : ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet. 
- the use of tr and its correct formatting 
- using man and --help is critical
