## Level 3 → Level 4

## Goal 
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

## Solution

### Commands Used
```bash
ls 
cd inhere
ls -la
cat ...Hiding-From-You

```

### Explanation
This room clearly wanted to test if we would pick up that the dots at the front were actually part of the file name. After using ls -la to view the hidden files i was then able t0 access the password, admittedly i didnt realise the dots were part of the name of the file at first lol.

### Key Concepts
- accessing hidden files using ls -la 
- being attentive to file names
